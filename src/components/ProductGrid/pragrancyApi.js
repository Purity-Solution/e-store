      "We know that babies find a lot of comfort in breastfeeding. That is because sucking is among the very few sensations that they learn right from the womb. Sucking can calm babies down, lower their heart rate and blood pressure, and give them a sense of security. Giving the baby a pacifier helps to meet the same need which is why babies calm down when sucking on one. The best pacifiers for newborn babies are ones that are light, easy for the baby to hold and are made of safe material. ",

      "Is a pacifier for newborns good or bad for the baby? The use of pacifiers has undergone a lot of debate with some parents worrying that it may be habit forming like thumb-sucking or that it will adversely affect the oral development of the baby. A bottle feeding baby can be given a pacifier right from birth but most paediatricians recommend waiting till one month after birth before introducing a newborn to the benefits of pacifier use. This is because the baby will need to get used to the idea of feeding from the bottle first. Breastfeeding babies can be introduced to pacifiers at birth. Use a good quality pacifier from reputed brands like PIGEON where a lot of research has been undertaken to ensure that the baby has a comfortable experience with the pacifier. ",

      "Newborn pacifiers help the babies to calm down when they are fussing, offer a temporary distraction during vaccinations and blood tests, reduce the risk of SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome), and to sleep better. Due to poor hand-mouth coordination, newborn babies are unable to suck their fingers so it is a relief to be provided with a pacifier. Choose from PIGEON pacifiers that are made from silicone material that fit easily in the baby’s mouth and provide more airflow in order to prevent the baby’s skin from irritation ",
